# bitherder-docker-test
Just a simple exploration of using multiple Docker images/containers

## Goals

* final docker image composed of reasonably sane pre-images
* ssh daemon running in each Docker instance with some coherent login key set-up
* demonstrate the environment passed to docker instance is received by app
* app not running as root
* some sort of external logging
* Dockerfile part of application code
